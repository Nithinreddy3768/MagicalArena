Every Player is defined by a “health” attribute, “strength” attribute and an “attack” attribute - all positive integers. The player dies if his health attribute touches 0.
Any two player can fight a match in the arena. Players attack in turns. Attacking player rolls the attacking dice and the defending player rolls the defending dice.
